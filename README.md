# Popochiu Sample Game

A very short adventure to showcase how Popochiu works.

The Godot Project contains the latest working version of Popochiu. You can use this starting point to explore, experiment, and dissect the engine's basic functions. Clone it locally, mess with it as much as you want, or just use it as a starting point for your next game, removing unwanted stuff and adding your own.

**Current version is based on Popochiu 2.0-beta1**
